# Udemy-VBA-Project
#### This repository contains some Excel VBA code which I wrote when I was taking an online course on Udemy. My solid programming knowledge helped me a lot for learning VBA. It is really funny, useful and easy to learn. 
##### One thing mentioned again and again by Kyle is that since the Marco cannot undo after a run, it is better to save the file before we rest our Marco code. If there is something wrong made by the Marco, we can close the file and click 'do not save' and then reopen it. Then, everything would be changed back to the original look.
###### 1. Prompt Table to Sort Records.txt : 
* Made a prompt table to give users several options to sort different columns and also notice users when they provide wrong options.
###### 2. CleaningUpData.txt :
* Created a loop to run two recorded Marcos multiple times to add formatted headers to all worksheets inside the workbook.
###### 3. AutomateSumFunction.txt :
* Created a loop to automate SUM function and adjust format for all worksheets in the workbook.
###### 4. QuarterlyReport.txt :
* Wrote VBA code to clean up and summarize the quarterly reports, copy the data from each worksheet, and paste in the yearly report worksheet. 
###### 5. QuarterlyReportForm-01.xlsm (module.txt, this workbook.txt, userform.txt)
* Created a prompt table which allowed users to:
browse worksheets by clicking the worksheet name in the drop-down list, and clicking the button to create & name new blank worksheet, and produce the final yearly report.
* module.txt contains the procedures which clean the quarterly selling data and create the yearly selling report; this workbook.txt contains code which allows the prompt to appear when the workbook file open; userform.txt contains the code to create the prompt table. 
###### 6. 
* PS: User From is not avaliable in mac Excel 2016 version....
###### Note: 
* Use F8 to run a single line of code each time;
* & is used to combine multiple string values together;
