# Udemy-VBA-Project
#### This repository contains some Excel VBA code which I wrote when I was taking an online course on Udemy. My solid programming knowledge helped me a lot for learning VBA. It is really funny, useful and easy to learn. 
##### One thing mentioned again and again by Kyle is that since the Marco cannot undo after a run, it is better to save the file before we rest our Marco code. If there is something wrong made by the Marco, we can close the file and click 'do not save' and then reopen it. Then, everything would be changed back to the original look.
###### 1. Prompt Table to Sort Records.txt : 
* Made a prompt table to give users several options to sort different columns and also notice users when they provide wrong options.
###### 2. CleaningUpData.txt :
* Created a loop to run two recorded Marcos multiple times to add formatted headers to all worksheets inside the workbook.
###### Note: Use F8 to run a single line of code each time.
